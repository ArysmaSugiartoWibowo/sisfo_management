This web-based Internship Registration Management System was developed for Kominfo as a part of a final project in 2024.

The system was built using:

    CodeIgniter 3 as the PHP framework

    AdminLTE for a responsive and clean admin dashboard UI

    MySQL for database management

    A touch of JavaScript for form validation and client-side enhancements

The platform allows students to register for internships, while administrators can manage applicant data, internship schedules, and general settings through a dynamic admin panel.

It was created to improve the efficiency and organization of internship registration processes at Kominfo
